The app processes chat text files to extract structured data into a DataFrame. It identifies timestamps, senders, and message contents while handling multiline messages and system notifications.

Preprocessing
--------------
Cleans chat messages by:
- Removing stopwords (e.g., "the", "and").
- Tokenizing text.
- Eliminating punctuation.

Topic Modeling
---------------
Utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to group conversations into topics. Each topic is represented by a set of key terms.

Visualizations
---------------
Interactive charts provide actionable insights, making it easier to understand chat trends and topics.
